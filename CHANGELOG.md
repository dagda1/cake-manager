# Cake

## [v0.1.0]
- **Breaking:** Remove Java, this is a frontend react interview (I hope)
- Set up yarn workspaces, typescript, webpack
- Simple express server that returns basic json
- I use webpack to bundle, but grunt is still useful for basic build tasks or else we need to write a lot of bash or node
